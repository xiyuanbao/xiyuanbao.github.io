I am also very interested in developing and applying novel methodologies, including both end-to-end and generalizable approaches to address various challenging problems in geophysics.

Specificlly, I focus on:


- State-of-the-art laboratory fluid dynamic experiments
 and analysis workflow tailored for viscous convection
  applicable to planetary interiors [@Bao2024a;@b7Bao2023c;@b3Bao2025g].
  They are based on real-world physics and especially suitable 
  to investigate multi-scale flow.

- Digital twins of lab experiments based on a hybrid-adjoint method [@Bao2024PhD].
These fully quantified numerical models are tightly constrained
 by 4D lab measurements, but they further extend
 the results in space and time and even to unmeasured quantities.

and reconstruction of unmeasured temperature field (right) Ra=1e6~1e8](gallery/PIV_31.mp4)


- Machine learning and AI methods to analyze, simulate
 and invert complex geophysical systems. 
 These include data mining from 
 geophysical and geochemical data [@c1Bao2022;@aBao2024a;@a7Bao2025a], 
 as well as forward and inverse modeling 
 with physics-infomred neural networks (PINNs) [@Bao2024PhD] 
 and neural operators [@a7Bao2025b].
