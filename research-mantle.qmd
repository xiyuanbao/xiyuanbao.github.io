**What is the present-day physical and chemical state of the solid Earth?
How did it dynamically evolve over geological time,
leaving behind the geological, geophysical and geochemical signatures across the globe?**


My research on solid Earth dynamics focuses on the following aspects:



- Data-based interpretation of global volcanism, 
at hotspots [@c1Bao2022;@b6Cai2025a],
mid-ocean ridges [@aBao2024a; @a2Zhang2023a;@a1Zhang2023b] 
and subduction zones [@a0Li2023].

- Dynamicial modeling of mantle plume evolution pathways, 
source entrainment and surface expressions [@Bao2024a;@b7Bao2023c;@b3Bao2025g].

- Constrianing the distribution of deep mantle heterogeneities and rheological properties [@a7Bao2025a;@bao2024giant]
