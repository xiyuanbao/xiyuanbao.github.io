How do surface processes shape the environment we live in,
and how do they interact with the solid Earth interior, with implications for planetary evolution and habitability?

My work on surface processes and interior-surface coupling focuses on:

A statistically significant correlation between the two fields (P < 0.001) provides an unambiguous observational detection of the near-field sea level fingerprint of recent GrIS melting in our warming world.
